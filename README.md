# Leaflet Challenge: Earthquake Visualization

## Overview
This project visualizes earthquake data provided by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) using Leaflet.js. It creates an interactive map that allows users to explore global earthquake occurrences based on their location, magnitude, and depth.

## Features
- **Dynamic Earthquake Markers**:
  - The size of each marker reflects the earthquake's magnitude.
  - The color of each marker reflects the earthquake's depth.
- **Interactive Popups**:
  - Each marker includes a popup showing the earthquake's location, magnitude, and depth.
- **Legend**:
  - A legend explains the color coding for earthquake depth.

## Data Source
The earthquake data comes from the USGS GeoJSON Feed:
- [USGS GeoJSON Feed](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php)

## Technologies Used
- **Leaflet.js**: For interactive map creation and visualization.
- **D3.js**: For fetching and processing GeoJSON data.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: For the project's structure, styling, and functionality.
